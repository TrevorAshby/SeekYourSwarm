        <p>The primary intended user of the Club Finder app that is being designed for this project is for people who have lost access and connectivity to their past clubs and are looking for new clubs near them. The secondary intended user is a person who is interested in getting into an extracurricular activity and wants to see what type of clubs there are near them.</p>
        <p>John is a twenty-three year old recent college graduate who accepted a job away from everyone he knew. While in college, he was on a football team, and he was in the book club. John wants to join a new football team and join a new book club, but he has no idea where to look for clubs and teams that he can join, and he does not know anyone around him that can help either. John wants a Club Finder app that can give him the ability to find any football team and book club near him. He would like to see where and when they meet to see if it fits his schedule. Finally, he would also like to talk to the team and club before fully deciding whether to join them or not. </p>
        <p>Janice is a thirty-five year old office worker who wants to find a new hobby or extracurricular activity. She wants to look around and see which clubs and teams are available around her but doesnâ€™t know where to look. Janice wants a Club Finder app that can allow her to see all of the available clubs and teams near her area in order for her to make a final decision about where she wants to go. She would like to be able to see a list of clubs that are located around her in a specific radius. She would also like to be able to talk to the leaders of each club to get more information about the team and club, and she would like to see when they meet to see if they meet her schedule.</p>
