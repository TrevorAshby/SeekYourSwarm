        <p>The name of our software system will be Seek Your Swarm. 
            This system will be a web application that aims to help people find different clubs 
            where they can join others in their local communities. Users will create an account 
            and will be recommended clubs based on both the hobbies/preferences of the user and the 
            user's location in relation to the club's location. While scrolling/swiping through 
            the different club recommendations, the user can click onto a club they find interesting 
            and view the club’s profile. This profile will have listed the meeting times, meeting 
            locations, and the club leadership. The user can also directly message club officers for 
            more information. When joining the club, the user will enter a group chat with all the 
            other members for better communication. The club leaders will be the only ones able to 
            alter the club’s profile and will have moderator authority/responsibility over the internal group chat.
            </p> 
            <p>The motivation behind this program is that individuals who are graduating from school 
            will often lose access/connectivity to social clubs that might help them connect with 
            others in their community. With this new app, individuals in any stage of life can 
            connect with like-minded individuals based on their interests and sorted by geolocation. 
            With sports, local communities will generally have ‘recreational’ leagues that serve 
            local populations of their area and allow them to enjoy playing the sports they 
            love. Our program is meant to serve a similar purpose but with a broader scope. 
            While it isn’t a ‘dating app’ per se, our program will function similarly to 
            such an app, where the emphasis is on activities and groups that are closer 
            to the user’s actual location and interests and is specifically targeted 
            towards those who seek to build local connections in their area.</p>
