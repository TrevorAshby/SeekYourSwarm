        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Our design for Seek Your Swarm creates a solution for those who are looking to find social outlets in their region. The use of modular architecture structures this application into clearly defined components that each address functional and non-functional requirements. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon S3 ensure that user and club data is stored securely and remains easily scalable as the userbase expands. Security, usability and performance were key considerations that influenced our design, creating a reliable and user-friendly application that promotes meaningful social interactions. </p>
        <p>Each module plays an important role in making this platform effective and engaging. The User Interaction Module enhances user experience by allowing quick and secure communication among members. This fosters a sense of community and encourages participation in clubs. Seek Your Swarmâ€™s modular approach allows it to be easily adapted and enhanced in the future. Communication features could be expanded upon, and data processing capabilities could be upgraded to support growing demand. This flexibility extends to the user interface and backend, which could both be modified without significant changes to the other modules. </p>
        <p>Seek Your Swarm is a platform that is robust, scalable and secure. It meets the needs of those who are searching for community beyond academic or professional settings. Our high-level design is informed by consideration of user needs and technical requirements and allows the system to deliver both performance and usability, making it a very valuable tool for fostering social groups. </p>
